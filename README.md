Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aner Fidalgo


About me: My name is Aner Fidalgo, and ever since i was young, i always had a loved for all things technology, but didn't really realize til i was a little older. I still remembered when i picked up my first laptop like it was yesterday, I never really knew what to do with one except play video games on it of course. It wasn't till one of my best friends told me look into video editing that i really couldn't get off my laptop, spending hour and hours editing videos for people on fiver. Using softwares like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro i genuinely enjoyed just seeing others happy when their work was finished. After a while i wasn't recieving as much attraction, and just took a break from it. I have also been working in the Costumer service field. As of right now i'm just looking into expanding my knowledge in the things that i love the most which is technology. That's why i decided to attend Boca Code this spring and learn Javascript, and hopefully many more languages to add to my arsenal, as well as turning coding into a full time profession.
